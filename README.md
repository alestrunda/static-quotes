# Static Quotes

Rainmeter skin to display quotes right on your screen. I've styled more than 50 quotes. Very useful to have your favorite motivational quote always on site.

First add the skin - in directory *User/Documents/Rainmeter/Skins* create folder *StaticQuote* and put the *.ini* file in it. Activate the skin in Rainmeter.

Then simply pick one quote, uncomment (remove *;* characters at the beginning of each line) its parts, comment out the last one and refresh Rainmeter.
