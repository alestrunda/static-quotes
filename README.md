# Static Quotes

Rainmeter skin to randomly display quotes right on your screen. I've styled more than 60 quotes. Very useful to have your favorite motivational quote always on site.

First add the skin - in your user's directory *User/Documents/Rainmeter/Skins* create folder *StaticQuote* and put the *.ini* and *.lua* files in it. Activate the *StaticQuote* skin in Rainmeter.

It will randomly changes the quote every 24hrs. You can change the interval by editing variable *UpdateDivider*. If you do not want some quote to be picked, remove it's ID from the *Quotes* variable. The settings are in file *StaticQuote.ini*.
