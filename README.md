# Static Quotes

[Rainmeter](https://www.rainmeter.net/) skin to randomly display quotes right on your screen. I've styled more than 60 quotes (styled for HD screen but can be used on other sizes as well). Very useful to have your favorite motivational quote always in sight.

## Get started

Add the Rainmeter skin: in your user's directory *User/Documents/Rainmeter/Skins* create folder *StaticQuote* and put the *.ini* and *.lua* files in it. Activate the *StaticQuote* skin in Rainmeter.

It will randomly pick a quote and refresh it every 24hrs. You can change the interval by editing variable *UpdateDivider*. If you do not want some quote to be picked, remove it's ID from the *Quotes* variable. The settings are in file *StaticQuote.ini*.
